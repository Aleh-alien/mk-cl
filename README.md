## What's in the Box

* This is not a full web framework. There are no layout templates, no server, no database, etc.
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) live in your `public/vendor` folder.
* Icons can be made using [ionicons](http://ionicons.com/).
* Your custom styles are in `public/styles.css`.
* Put additional images in the `public/images` folder. 
* The contents of `index.php` makes heroku indentify this app as a PHP app and serve the `/index.html` file at the root of your url.
